    "description": "With this power, you can read a target\u2019s mind, probing whatever secrets are hidden therein. You must touch the target for this power to work, which, unless clever methods are employed, means you must successfully Test Weapon Skill. If you manage to touch the target, you may enter a contest of wills in order to pierce your target\u2019s mental barriers and discover all sorts of information. Mind Scan is a lengthy process, extending over five Rounds. During each of these Rounds the Psyker and target make Opposed Willpower Tests. If the Psyker succeeds, he may delve deeper into the target\u2019s psyche. Should the target succeed, it indicates that he has managed to thrust the Psyker from his mind, and the Mind Scan power ends. Each Round that Mind Scan is successfully maintained, the following information is revealed: Round 1 (Contact) Information: The Psyker contacts the target\u2019s mind, learning basic information such as name, mood, Insanity Level, physical health, and so on. Round 2 (Surface Thoughts) Information: The Psyker investigates the thoughts which are uppermost in the target\u2019s mind, such as opinions on the Psyker, immediate fears, conscious lies, a single location, object, event or person which is significant to the target (such as a lover, personal hab block, treasured heirloom or cult initiation). It is not apparent why the significant thing is important\u2014only the emotions associated with it. The target\u2019s Corruption Level is also apparent to the Psyker. Round 3 (Short Term Memory) Information: The Psyker may ri\u0000 e through the target\u2019s memories over the previous twelve hours, and may uncover two further significant locations, objects, events or persons. Again, it is not apparent why the significant thing is important\u2014only the key emotions associated with it. The Psyker may also dredge up simple passwords and routine behaviours from the target\u2019s mind (e.g. hab block entry code, habitual paths to work, bank ident numerals or frequently used Skills, Talents and Characteristics). Round 4 (Subconscious) Information: The Psyker may gain detailed understanding of why significant locations, objects, events or persons hold importance to the target, and how they relate to each other. The target\u2019s beliefs, motivations and personal goals are apparent to the Psyker, as are the target\u2019s immediate network of contacts. Complicated ciphers may be extracted from the target\u2019s mind, and the Psyker is aware of pivotal moments in the target\u2019s life (earliest memory, adolescence, coming of age and so on). Round 5 (Soul Baring) Information: The Psyker may plunder the target\u2019s mind at will. Any information contained within the target\u2019s psyche is there for the Psyker to do with what he wishes. The Psyker may attempt to scan his target\u2019s mind covertly. In this case, the Psyker must make an Opposed Willpower Test at a -10 penalty. Should the Psyker succeed in a covert scan, the target gains a faint sense of unease, but is unaware that his mind is being probed. If the Psyker does not attempt a covert scan, the target is fully aware that his psyche is under attack. He may attempt to break physical contact with the Psyker or even strike out. 179",

You must touch the target for this power to work, which, unless clever methods are employed, means you must successfully Test Weapon Skill. If you manage to touch the target, you may enter a contest of wills in order to pierce your target\u2019s mental barriers and discover all sorts of information. Mind Scan is a lengthy process, extending over five Rounds. During each of these Rounds the Psyker and target make Opposed Willpower Tests. If the Psyker succeeds, he may delve deeper into the target\u2019s psyche. Should the target succeed, it indicates that he has managed to thrust the Psyker from his mind, and the Mind Scan power ends. Each Round that Mind Scan is successfully maintained, the following information is revealed: Round 1 (Contact) Information: The Psyker contacts the target\u2019s mind, learning basic information such as name, mood, Insanity Level, physical health, and so on. Round 2 (Surface Thoughts) Information: The Psyker investigates the thoughts which are uppermost in the target\u2019s mind, such as opinions on the Psyker, immediate fears, conscious lies, a single location, object, event or person which is significant to the target (such as a lover, personal hab block, treasured heirloom or cult initiation). It is not apparent why the significant thing is important\u2014only the emotions associated with it. The target\u2019s Corruption Level is also apparent to the Psyker. Round 3 (Short Term Memory) Information: The Psyker may ri\u0000 e through the target\u2019s memories over the previous twelve hours, and may uncover two further significant locations, objects, events or persons. Again, it is not apparent why the significant thing is important\u2014only the key emotions associated with it. The Psyker may also dredge up simple passwords and routine behaviours from the target\u2019s mind (e.g. hab block entry code, habitual paths to work, bank ident numerals or frequently used Skills, Talents and Characteristics). Round 4 (Subconscious) Information: The Psyker may gain detailed understanding of why significant locations, objects, events or persons hold importance to the target, and how they relate to each other. The target\u2019s beliefs, motivations and personal goals are apparent to the Psyker, as are the target\u2019s immediate network of contacts. Complicated ciphers may be extracted from the target\u2019s mind, and the Psyker is aware of pivotal moments in the target\u2019s life (earliest memory, adolescence, coming of age and so on). Round 5 (Soul Baring) Information: The Psyker may plunder the target\u2019s mind at will. Any information contained within the target\u2019s psyche is there for the Psyker to do with what he wishes. The Psyker may attempt to scan his target\u2019s mind covertly. In this case, the Psyker must make an Opposed Willpower Test at a -10 penalty. Should the Psyker succeed in a covert scan, the target gains a faint sense of unease, but is unaware that his mind is being probed. If the Psyker does not attempt a covert scan, the target is fully aware that his psyche is under attack. He may attempt to break physical contact with the Psyker or even strike out. 179",
